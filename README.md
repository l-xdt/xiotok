## Run Locally

Clone the project and Run it on XAMPP (**PS:** I would recommend having a locally hosted domain for this step, it makes this process more satisfying.)

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd xiotok
```

Install XAMPP (via Choclately.)

```bash
  choclately install xampp
```

Start the server with a command

```bash
    [Directory]/[ServerName]/apache-start.bat
```


## Roadmap

- A XT in the style of TikTok as the FavIcon.

- Written By Hand

- Written in the Front-end Languages. HTML, CSS & Javascript.
